# lane-and-object-detection
This project implements real-time lane detection and object detection using computer vision techniques and deep learning models. It is designed for autonomous driving applications, assisting vehicles in detecting lanes and identifying obstacles on the road.
Lane Detection: Uses Canny edge detection, Hough Transform, and perspective transformation to identify lane boundaries.
Object Detection: Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model (YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN) to detect and classify vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs.
Real-time Processing: Optimized for video streams and dashcam footage.
Frame-by-frame Analysis: Processes each frame to provide lane markings and detected objects.
Customizable and Extendable: Can be integrated into self-driving car simulations or enhanced with additional features like traffic light detection.
